# instacart_final
This project was trying to understand the user behavior and user segmentation of Instacart 
from the order history on Instacart.

Dataset:
orders 
order_products_prior
order_products_train
aisle
departments
products

Main questions are:
1. How many orders on average each user have ordered?
2. How frequently did people reorder
3. When are orders placed over the day and over the week?
4. What products are trending on Instacart?
5. How many products do people order per order?
6. How many aisles do people order from per order?
7. Reorder rate of products
8. How users can be clustered into different segmentations through which aisle they order from? 
and what are the attributes of these users?

To answer these questions, we conducted descriptive analysis through Tableau which can be accessed through the deck; modeling
was done on Jupyter Notebook which was shared on GitHub. 

In modeling, we conducted principle component analysis to reduce the dimensions and k-means clustering.
We decided to work with aisle data specifically as it's between the level of products and departments
which is not too granular or too general. 

Main findings in descriptives are summarized in the deck. For modeling, we found 5 user segments,
and did persona analysis to understand user attributes. We have suggested Instacart to keep conducting
qualitative study to have a closer look at the user groups to understand their specific needs and
develop their product.
